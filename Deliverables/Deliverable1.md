# Deliverable 1 – Research & Requirements

## Project Title
Waste Management: Develop a Solution for Efficient Waste Collection and Recycling

## Problem Statement
Urban waste management faces severe inefficiencies due to inconsistent collection schedules, lack of recycling awareness, and limited real-time monitoring. This leads to overflowing bins, missed pickups, contamination of recyclable waste, and increased landfill use.

## Hypotheses
- Many cities still rely on fixed schedules instead of real-time fill-level data.
- Residents often mix recyclables with general waste due to poor segregation systems.
- There’s no effective feedback mechanism between citizens and waste collection authorities.

## Research Insights
- According to the World Bank, global waste is expected to grow by 70% by 2050.
- Smart waste bins (with sensors) can reduce operational costs by up to 30%.
- Recycling rates are directly linked to public education and convenient sorting.

## Proposed Solution
Build a digital platform that includes:
- Smart bins with fill-level sensors.
- A mobile/web app for collection schedule alerts.
- Real-time bin status monitoring for city officials.
- AI-based sorting recommendations.
- User feedback and reporting functionality.

## Requirements for Deliverable 2
- Functional requirements for users, city officials, and backend processing.
- System requirements (database, API, mobile app, IoT integration).
- Data privacy and security considerations.
